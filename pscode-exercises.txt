// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

variable number1 = 2
variable number2 = 2
print number1 + number 2


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

variable number
print "Enter a number: "
number = input
if number % 2 = 0 {
    number + " is even"
}
else {
    number + " is odd"
}

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

variable sum = 0
variable smallest = infinity
variable largest = -infinity
print "Enter 5 numbers"
for input = 1 to 5 {
    variable inputNumber = input
    sum = sum + inputNumber
    if inputNumber < smallest {
        smallest = inputNumber
    }
    if inputNumber > largest {
        largest = inputNumber
    }
}

variable average = sum / 5

print "The average of the numbers is " + average
print "The smallest number is " + smallest
print "The largest numbetr is " + largest
